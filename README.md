Notebooks
SIFT.ipynb:
Implements Scale-Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) to detect and match keypoints between two images.
‚û§ Images Used: car1.png, car2.png

Harris.ipynb:
Applies Harris Corner Detection algorithm to identify corners in an image.
‚û§ Image Used: img1.jpeg

Shi_Tomasi.ipynb:
Utilizes the Shi-Tomasi corner detection (Good Features to Track) to highlight strong corners.
